#Neural Network Implementation in TensorFlow
Welcome to my GitHub repository containing the Jupyter notebook for implementing a Neural Network from scratch using TensorFlow! ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

In this repository, you will find a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that walks you through the step-by-step process of building a Neural Network model using TensorFlow's core functionality. The notebook serves as an excellent resource for understanding the inner workings of Neural Networks and gaining hands-on experience in their implementation.

Key Features:

Core TensorFlow Implementation: This project emphasizes the lower-level implementation of Neural Networks using TensorFlow, allowing you to grasp the fundamentals and gain a deeper understanding of how Neural Networks function.

Gradient Descent Algorithm: The notebook covers the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm using TensorFlow's automatic differentiation. You will learn how to optimize the model's performance by updating the model parameters based on the computed gradients.

Feel free to clone and explore the repository. You can run the notebook locally in Jupyter or any compatible environment to interact with the code, experiment with different configurations, and deepen your understanding of Neural Networks.
